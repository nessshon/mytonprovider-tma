![My TON Provider](app/frontend/public/banner.png)

**My TON Provider** is a Telegram Mini App for monitoring TON storage providers, in Telegram or the browser:
provider catalog with search, sorting and filters; status, telemetry, hardware and network details; alerts on
downtime, overload and restarts; favorites, theme and language synced to the account; owner metrics, earnings,
balance and charts once ownership is verified.

## Usage

1. Copy the environment file and fill it in (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)):

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Build and start with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

The frontend is compiled into the backend's static directory, migrations run, and the service starts on `:8080`.

### Backups

Once a day the app writes a compacted snapshot of the database to `app/backend/data/backups/` and keeps the
last 14. The snapshot is taken while the app keeps writing, so it needs no downtime.

To restore, stop the app, put a snapshot in place of `database.sqlite`, delete the `-wal` and `-shm` files
next to it, and start again.

### Health

`GET /health` reports one of three states, public and not rate-limited:

| Response                                        | Code  | Meaning                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------------------|
| `{"status": "ok", "stale": []}`                  | `200` | serving, every worker on schedule              |
| `{"status": "degraded", "stale": ["…Worker"]}`   | `200` | serving, the listed workers are behind         |
| `{"status": "down", "stale": []}`                | `503` | the database does not answer                   |

`503` means the app cannot serve, so restarting it is the right response; a worker falling behind is not that
and stays `200`. Point uptime monitors at the status code and, for the degraded case, at the `"status": "ok"`
keyword. Docker Compose polls the same endpoint as its health check.

### Local development

Backend:

```bash
cd app/backend
alembic upgrade head
python -m app
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd app/frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

The dev server proxies `/api` to `$BACKEND`, `http://localhost:8080` by default, so the frontend can run against a
local backend or a deployed one (`BACKEND=https://example.org pnpm dev`, or the same line in `app/frontend/.env.local`).
Outside Telegram the app authenticates through the Telegram Login Widget, which only works on the domain registered
with the bot.

The frontend reads three more variables, inlined by Vite at build time rather than read from the runtime `.env`:

| Variable            | Description                                                                      | Default                     |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `VITE_BACKEND_BASE` | This backend's origin; in production one process serves both the app and the API | same origin                 |
| `VITE_API_BASE`     | Public catalog API                                                               | `https://mytonprovider.org` |
| `VITE_TG_CLIENT_ID` | Telegram Login Widget client ID; Docker Compose bakes it from `TG_CLIENT_ID`     | empty                       |
